# Picturing LGBTQ2+ Resistance

![alternativetxt](/img/Equality-coin.jfif)

In the Spring of 2019, the Canadian Mint released a coin commemorating 50 years of LGBTQ2+ rights. The coin itself references the 1969 decriminalization of homosexuality and encourages Canadians to think about how much progress has been made in the last half-century. However, this coin leaves much to be desired and hides more than most Canadians realize. To celebrate fifty years of LGBTQ2+ when the Canadian Government actively discriminated against its own employees, firing thousands and destroying the lives of many is disingenuous and inaccurate to say the least. So, what is Canada’s relationship with LGBTQ2+ communities and why are so many people upset about this coin?

**It’s time to flip the coin and learn more about Canada’s not-so-cold war on queers.**

Beginning in 1950, the Canadian Government began purging its workforce of LGBTQ individuals—this included the public service and the Armed Forces. Spanning almost fifty years, 1950-1990, the LGBTQ Purge was facilitated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Department of National Defence (DND) and the Department of National Health and Welfare (NHW). In order to enhance Canadian security during the Cold War gay men and lesbian women were interviewed, interrogated, humiliated, assaulted and dismissed from their careers. Perceived as a threat to security, LGBTQ government employees were believed to be at a higher risk for blackmail and understood to be unstable and unreliable individuals. 

Beginning in 1962, only seven year prior to the legalization of homosexuality (Bill C-150), the government commissioned a system to detect gay people: The Fruit Machine. Based on American security technology and created by Carleton University Professor Dr. Frank R. Wake the project involved a series of tests that would register a person’s response to visual stimuli. Some examples of the tests include measuring palm sweat and pupil dilation when exposed to pornographic images as well as word associations. De-commissioned 1967, The Fruit Machine was not successful and produced inconsistent results, however, this did not stop the RCMP from using it to fire employees.

With the legalization of homosexuality in 1969, the Government of Canada symbolically declared that the government had no stake in the bedrooms of the nations, but legally only partially reformed their policy on buggery and gross indecency. It was not until 1988 that gross indecency was fully removed as an offense. 

Additionally, the Canadian Government did not issue an apology or seek to compensate the thousands of public servants affected until 2017, sixty-seven years after the start of the LGBTQ Purge. Some survivors of the LGBTQ Purge have been compensated, some have died and still some remain employed by the Armed Forces or the Canadian Government. 

Although it may seem like resistance was impossible, there are many stories of resilience and subversion. Through acts, big and small, LGBTQ public servants resisted by not providing information, by openly taking pride in their identities, by creating humorous songs to warn their friends of government surveillance and by partying in their private homes or trusted bars.

To be candid, if I had the option, I would choose not to mint this coin at all. It is dishonest and erases the struggles of LGBTQ2+ communities in Canada. However, if I were to redesign this coin there are two options I would consider: celebrating LGBTQ resistance to the Purge or changing the dates to reflect what we’re truly commemorating. In the case of commemorating queer resistance, I would turn to queer communities today and ask them what symbols are important to them. So, my design would feature a pink triangle (referencing the Act Up! Movement and the Nazi prisoners of war) and the words, “Resist, Reform, Remember” 1950-1990. In the second scenario, my coin would read: “Reform for Equality,” 1988-2019.
